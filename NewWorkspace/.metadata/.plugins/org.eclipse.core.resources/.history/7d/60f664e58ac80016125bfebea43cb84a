  As an administrator at Syncbak,
  I want to make sure all the elements on the home page are there,
  In order to ensure quality product for my clients.

  Background: Must be logged in and in the correct testing location
    Given I am on the landing page
    And I am logged in to Syncpanel2

  Scenario: Basic smoke test for the Syncpanel2 home page
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then it should contain these tabs
